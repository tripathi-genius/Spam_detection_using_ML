# Spam_detection_using_ML


I created this repository as ML work which uses some famous ML algorithms to find wheather a mail is spam or ham.
We neeed these algorithms as it may prevent user from a potential global fraud.
It also helps to find the genuine emails, and it helps servers to safeguard your email inbox from annoying messages.

I used SVM and perceptron model to find spam in this repository.

Please cite if you need this code.
